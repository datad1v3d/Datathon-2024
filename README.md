# Datathon-2024
Developed a machine learning using a multioutput random forest regressor model to predict oil, gas, and water production 
based on historical records. 
By analysing past production data and associated parameters, I applied the 
standard machine learning (ML) workflow to accurately forecast production profile of the oil, 
gas, and water. 


# Results 
Average RMSE oil = 0.05049954, Gas = 0.05201793, Water 0.04564428, Best Outcome = 0
Average R_2 Oil = 0.95607371, Gas = 0.9515781 , Water = 0.95931258, Best Outcome = 1
Average MAE Oil = 0.01768081,Gas = 0.01864, water = 0.01765056, Best Outcome = 0
Total Production Estimation Oil = 64,275,890.94 bbl , Gas = 52,916,507,482.92 scf,  
water =91,827,539.61bbl
